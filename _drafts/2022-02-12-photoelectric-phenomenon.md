Electron, by the way, is another bundle of energy acting like a wave or particle depending on how you observe it.


This emitted floating photoelectron is instable and end ups spontaneously emitting a photon in a while. This new photon then carries on its journey towards out eye. Electron ends up somewhere. WRONG!
