## double slit for an atom

It is not the atom causing the interference on the film, it's photons. Does the atom pass the slit or only the photons, really?

by viktor toth:

It is not.

The moment you imagine that atom as a miniature cannonball that is in two places at once, you lost the game: you are failing to understand quantum mechanics.

Quantum mechanics does not say that the atom is in two places at once. What quantum mechanics says is that the atom has no classically defined position at all between measurements. Its position, rather than being represented by a set of numbers (as in classical mechanics, where the position would be a set of coordinates), is represented instead by the so-called position operator. Unlike the numbers, the position operator does not tell us where the atom is. The atom is neither here nor there, nor anywhere else. The position operator tells us how likely it is that we find the atom at a particular place, if we look. It does not tell us where the atom is.

But when you actually look and find the atom somewhere, the atom is in exactly one place: the place where you found it. It is never in two places at once. However, most of the time (that is, always when you are not looking) it is in no place at all, in a classical sense, as it has no well-defined position.

(And just to be clear, when I somewhat whimsically say, “when you are not looking”, I don’t really mean that a human or a cat has to look at the atom for it to have a position. No, the atom simply has to interact with a macroscopic object or instrument, one that consists of a very large number of particles such that any quantum behavior is averaged out and it behaves classically.)
