## What's light

People naturally think of light in connection of their vision. In that context, common understanding is that light is a beam or a ray of electromagnetic radiation traveling in the air. Produced e.g. in the Sun, Traveling through space to Earth, reflecting from various objects around us and eventually reaching our eyes. Caught by cone cells and transferred to our brain. Where this one ray adds up in the view of our surroundings rendered in our brain.  

That's not incorrect. A bit simplistic though.

Quantummechanically light is made of a bundles of energy called photons. Photons can act like waves or particles depending on the context. See section Wave-Particle duality.

Photon is born once an electron emits one. This can happen in in Sun's core (see Tunneling) or it can happen e.g. in your electric torch. Once reaching space or air, it travels as a wave without interruption, as surroundings is mostly empty. 
When the photon wave then hits an atom, it's energy causes one of it's electrons being excited.

 Electron, by the way, is another bundle of energy acting like a wave or particle depending on how you observe it.

This emitted floating photoelectron is instable and end ups spontaneously emitting a photon in a while. This new photon then carries on its journey towards out eye. Electron ends up somewhere.
