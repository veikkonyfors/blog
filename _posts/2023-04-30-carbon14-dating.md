# Carbon14 Dating

C14 is an isotope of Carbon with 6 protons and 8 neutrons in it's nucleus. It is an unstable radioactive isotope.  
In radiactive decay, one of it's neutrons turns into a proton. C14 itself turns to be N14. An electron as well as an anti-neutrino is emitted in this process.  Electron flow is called Beta radiation and anti-neutrino turns mostly out as energy.  
This is what's called [Weak Nuclear Interaction](../../../img/2023-04-30-carbon14-dating/weak_interaction.mp4)

Amount of C14 in atmosphere is one trillionth of that of other stable isotopes C12 and C13. Living organisms gather C14 in the same proportion in their bodies when they are alive.  
When they die, C12 and C13 will stay in dead bodies, but C14 keeps on radioactive decaying. Thus it's amount in the body will decrease over time.   
Radioactive half-life of C14 is 5700 years, i.e. in 5700 years it's amount in a dead body will decrease to half of the original.  
By analysing amount of C14 in proportion to C12 and C13, one can deduce the age of the body.
