## Electricity

In order to be able to proceed acquainting on quantum mechanics and general relativity, it became evident one needs to be somewhat familiar with electromagnetism. Actually quite a lot.
That was my intuition from the beginning, but now it has turned out to be a necessity to carry on. Thus, now familiarizing with electromagnetism as well. Starting this journey with wrapping up main points in electricity.  



### Electric charge
If an object has more electrons than protons, object's charge is said to be negative. Positive if vice versa. Neutral otherwise.  
An electron's charge is called elementary charge and is marked with $e$  
Unit of measure for electric charge is Coulomb (C).  
Electric charge is denoted by letter Q.

$1C = \frac{e}{1.60217653\cdot10^{-19}} \hspace{1em} \hspace{1em} i.e. \hspace{1em} 1C \sim 6.242\cdot 10^{18}e$

### Electric force
When you have two electric charges , Q and q, nearby each other, they will have a force affecting between them. Opposite charges have attractive force between them, like charges repel each other. Let's say charges are at distance r, in which case the force between them is characterized by formula

$\text{Coulomb's law:} \hspace{1em} \vec{F_{e}}= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}  \sim  \frac{kg\cdot m^3}{s^2\cdot C^2}\cdot \frac{C^2}{m^2}=\frac{kg m}{s^2}=J$

$\text{Where $\epsilon_{0}$ is vacuum permittivity:} \hspace{1em}\epsilon_{0}=8.8541878128(13)Ã—10^{-12} \frac{F}{m}$

$F=farad \sim \frac{s^{4}A^{2}}{kgm^{2}} $


### Electric Field
Electric field is an area, where there is force effecting on an electric charge at each of it's points.  
An electric charge creates an electric field around it.  
Strength of the electric field at each  point is defined to be the force effecting a charge Q at that point divided by Q itself:  

$\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F}}{q}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{Q}{r^{2}}$

*Q* &nbsp; is the source charge constituting electric field $\vec{E}$, which induces electric force $\vec{F}$ affecting charge *q*&nbsp; put at the distance of *r*&nbsp; from the source charge *Q*.

$\text{Unit of vacuum permittivity}=\frac{s^{4}A^{2}}{kgm^{3}}$

$\implies \text{Unit of } \vec{E} \text{ :} \hspace{1em} \frac{kgm^{3}}{s^{4}A^{2}} \frac{As}{m}= \frac{kgm^2}{s^{3}A}=
\frac{kgm^2}{s^{3}\frac{C}{s}} = \frac{kgm^2}{s^{2}\cdot C} = \frac{N}{C}$ 

### Electric current
Electric field makes electric charges to move in it. Moving electric electric charges create an electric current in turn.  
Electric current is measured by amperes (amps, A): One Coulomb of elementary charges in a second.

$1A=1\frac{C}{s}, \implies C=As$

On a metallic wire, an electric field is created within it when its ends are connected to a power supply. This make loosely connected electrons on outer shell of the metal to start moving in the field.  

Moving electric charge can also be bigger entities, like [ions](../../../2022/09/20/ions.html). If table salt, $Na^+Cl^-$ is dissolved in water, Na^+ and Cl- ions get separated due to water molecules dipole effect. Once an electric field is generated in this liquid, ions start to travel along the field.
