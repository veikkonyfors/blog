## Special Relativity

### Mass and energy are equivalent.

Partly formed by momentum (e.g. photon in mind):

$\hspace{1em}E=\sqrt {p^{2}c^{2}+m^{2}c^{4}}, \hspace{1em} p=mv$


Energy for a moving object (?):

$\hspace{1em}E=\frac{1}{\sqrt {1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} mc^{2}$

### Time and mass are dependent of velocity

For time, time dilation:
$$
\\t^{'}=\frac{t_0}{\sqrt {1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}, \hspace{1em} \text{where}\\
t_0=\text{proper time of the object in move}\\
v=\text{relative speed between objects}\\
t'=\text{time observed in observing object's frame}\\
$$

Example:\\
I have two synchronized precision clocks A and B 18x10^8 m apart from each other.\\
A satellite is traveling above on the sky with speed 1.8x10^8 m/s, in line with my clocks. There's a clock C in the satellite, which is synchronized with my clocks.  
I measure with my clocks it takes 10 seconds for the satellite to take from over clock A to over clock B.  
What will the clock C show when over clock B?  

$$
10=\frac{t_0}{\sqrt {1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \Rightarrow t_0=\sqrt {1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}*10=
\sqrt {1-\frac{(1.8*10^8)^2}{(3*10^8)^{2}}}*10=8
$$

Thus, satellite's clock ticked 8 times whereas mine did 10.

Relative mass:
$$
\\m=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt {1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \text{where}\\
m_0=\text{rest mass of the object in move}\\
v=\text{relative speed between objects}\\
m'=\text{mass observed in observing object's frame}\\
$$


### Lorenz's transformation

Frame of reference with ' is moving along x axis in stable speed u.  
Point S=(x,y,z) in view of moving reference frame with ' becomes S=(x',y',z'). Also time gets changed.  
Traditional Galilean transformation needed to be enhanced to comply with Maxwell equations:

$x^'=\frac{x-ut}{\sqrt{1-\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}}}$

$y^'=y$

$z^'=z$

$t^'=\frac{t-\frac{ux}{c^{2}}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}}}$

### Relativity factor

$g=\frac{1}{\sqrt {1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}$
