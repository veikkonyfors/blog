# Zeno's paradox 

While philosopher Zeno presented his paradox long before quantum mechanics was born, I still categorize it as a quantum paradox. Quantum mechanics gives the best shot to explain the paradox, you see.

In short:  
Tortoise and a rabbit decide to run a 100m flat race against each other. Just to make sure for good which one is faster.  
Rabbit is confident he runs twice as fast as tortoise and gives a 50m head start. Once rabbit then cathes 50m line, tortoise has already advanced to 87.5m. When rabbit reaches that point, tortoise is again already some way gone. This goes on, tortoise has always moved a bit further and rabbit is not able to overtake tortoise ever.

Sounds reasonable, doesn't it? Eh, no! We know by experience rabbit would pass tortoise easily.

Human mind has just become accustomed to classical mechanics way of thinking in this matter. In this case infinite series of ever decreasing distances converging to 100m. But in 'Newtonian math' newer actually reaching it.

Quantum mechanics brings the relief. Planck's length 1.616255 Ã— 10<sup>-35</sup> designates the smallest possibly perceptible distance. One can't divide that anymore to halves. This makes the trick. Rabbit passes tortoise at Planck's scale.  
Not very intuitive in the end, after all. But so is quantum mechanics in various ways.

Similar things come up in Relativity as well.  
E.g. few people, if any, can perceive curved 4D spacetime in a clear intuitive manner. I can't.  
And have seen no intuitive presentation of it. E.g. why does the ball fall down to earth when I drop it? It doesn't get circulating the earth. As the common visualization of bent membrane with heavy ball in the middle and a smaller one circulating around seems to suggest.

It's just that our minds have evolved in 3D ordinary world.
