## Principle of Equality

Think of a person in a space ship accelerating away from earth. On the ship, there is a photon emitter in the front and an absorber in the back. First one photon is emitted and then a second one in a second's time. First photon is received at the emitter and the other one shortly afterwards. But the time difference between first and second reception is somewhat less than a second, as the ship had accelerated it's speed a bit, and the distancefor thew photon to travel was a bit shorter.
