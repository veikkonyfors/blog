## Being a particle

Being a particle, like a photon or an electron, that would be somewhat of a schizophrenic life. You see, for long scientists have been pondering whether they should think of those as particles or waves. Proof on behalf of both views exist.

I wonder if they are something in between. Or could they be both? What I really think is the latter, only that they are either at different times. At one time, a wave like thing traveling in spacetime with probabilities of having specific location. Wavefunction describing these probabilities. Without being perceivable to humans. Only when it interacts with an atom of some material, it becomes perceptible to humans. At location ruled by the wavefunction's probabilities.

Let's have a look on a photon traveling as a wave in spacetime. Actually one can't have a look on it, as it is unperceivable :-). We just have to believe it is traveling as a wave. Ok, then it hits an atom on the way, say a petal of a yellow flower. An atom on the petal absorbs the photon wave and after a very short time emits another photon wave. See details on this transaction of absorbing-emitting a photon at article [What's light](https://veikkonyfors.github.io/blog/2022/02/03/what-is-light.html). This new photon wave then might eventually be captured by your eye to participate in building up the illusion in your brain of the yellow flower.

Wait just a sec. At what point of time the photon would be a particle in the preceding scenario? Never, as I see it. After having been a wave with a bunch of energy, it releases the energy to the atom's electron. No particle there. Then the excited atom releases the same amount of energy in the form of a new photon wave. No particle there either! Nor is there a particle in your eye's cone or rod cell interaction with the photon wave. The same goes on from that onwards, no particles around.

Oh my, the photon is just always a wave with a bunch of energy, all it's life. Until it ceases to exist once it's energy is absorbed in an interaction like the one described above. 

Thus, a photon never exists as a particle actually. It has always been just imagination of us humans, as it looks a bit as if particles would be hitting the film on the detectors of the test equipments. But really it is just the excited electron causing the film to react. Not the photon in particle form.
