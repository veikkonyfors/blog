## Superposition collapse

It is commonly stated that observation makes superposition (or wavefunction) collapse. To me it doesn't look like that, rather it looks like a misunderstanding due to human egocentricity.

Let's have a look on it, starting from some elementary things first.  
 
I will use photon as a sample of a quantum object. But this applies on all [quantum objects](https://veikkonyfors.github.io/blog/2022/04/16/quantum-objects)

In superposition state, quantum object is a bunch of energy, with all of it's properties wiggling wildly. One can't say what the spin, momentum, location or any other of the quantum properties are. 

Superposition is the kind of normal state for any quantum object. Only when an interaction with some other object takes place, superposition ceases to exist and the energy is given to the other party. We say the superposition or wavefunction gets collapsed. At this stage quantum properties will be determined by the probabilities of corresponding wavefunction.

Like a photon of blue light traveling all the way from sun to earth, it is in superposition most of the travel. When it reaches upper atmoshere, it interacts with some molecule there, loosing it's superposition. It gets scattered as we say. Nobody is there to make an observation of any kind, it only [bounces](https://veikkonyfors.github.io/blog/2022/02/08/what-is-light.html#photon_bouncing) into another blue photon being in superposition. This may happen over and over again. Eventually a descendant blue photon hits our cone or rod cell, superposition collapses, creating an electric signal into optic nerve. This time the collapse of superposition was observed.

When the collapse takes place, the other party doesn't have to be anything that would make it to be visible for humans. Like the atoms in upper atmosphere.  
If the target of interaction happens to be something, that leaves a trace for us humans to be seen, then we are pretty near to the case, where people keep on saying observation collapsed the wavefunction. 
 
But that's not the whole truth, it's only a kind of side effect. The collapse would had taken place anyway, the other party just happened to be something we humans are able to take notice of. Like a film or cathode-ray tube.
E.g. in [double slit experiment](https://veikkonyfors.github.io/blog/2022/03/20/double-slit-experiment-single-photon-interference.html), if we replace the measuring device(s) besides the slits with anything at all, the interference pattern would be lost anyway, even if there is no  observation around.
