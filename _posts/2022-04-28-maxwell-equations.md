## Maxwell's equations

In order to be able to proceed acquainting to quantum mechanics, it became evident one needs to be somewhat familiar with electromagnetism. Actually quite a lot.
That was my intuition from the beginning, but now it has turned out to be a necessity to carry on. Thus, now familiarizing with electromagnetism as well. Starting this journey with wrapping up Maxwell's equations with concepts it requires.

### Electric charge
If an object has more electrons than protons, object's charge is said to be negative. Positive if vice versa. Neutral otherwise.

### Electric field
When you have two electric charges , Q and q, nearby each other, they will have a force affecting between them. Opposite charges have attractive force between them, like charges repel each other. Let's say charges are at distance r, in which case the force between them is characterized by formula

$\text{Coulomb's law gives force between the charges}: \vec{F_{e}}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{Qq}{r^{2}}$

$ \implies \frac{\vec{F_{e}}}{q}= \vec{E} \hspace{1em} (\text{electric field strength}) =\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{Q}{r^{2}}$

$\text{With vacuum permittivity:} \hspace{1em}\epsilon_{0}=8.8541878128(13)Ã—10^{-12} \frac{F}{m}$

$F=farad \sim \frac{s^{4}A^{2}}{kgm^{3}} $

$\implies \text{Unit of vacuum permittivity}=\frac{kgm^{3}}{s^{4}A^{2}}$

$\implies \text{Unit of } \vec{E} \text{ :} \hspace{1em} \frac{kgm^{3}}{s^{4}A^{2}} \frac{As}{m^{2}}= \frac{kgm}{s^{3}A}$ 

*Q* &nbsp; is the source charge constituting electric field $\vec{E}$, which induces electric force $\vec{F}$ affecting charge *q*&nbsp; put at the distance of *r*&nbsp; from the source charge *Q*.
