## Quantum objects and properties

Photons, electrons, atoms and even molecules up to certain size are typical samples of quantum objects per current understanding.  
Quantum objects may have various measurable quantum properties like position, momentum, angular momentum, energy or spin.  
A single quantum object may have several distinct measurable quantum properties. Like electron with it's spin, location and momentum.  
Normally only one state is dealt with in one test. It would get too complicated otherwise.   

Above objects and measurables are actually ones we have so far mostly dealt with. Those we have understood at least in some amount. I can imagine there's lots of objects and properties to be discovered, we haven't just been able to comprehend those yet with our limited understanding.

It was mentioned above, that normally only one property is measured as otherwise things get complicated. One such complication is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: it is not possible to simultaneously measure accurately two associated properties, like position and velocity. The more precisely other one is measured, the more blurry it gets with the other one.
