## Quantum objects and properties

Quantum objects obey rules of quantum mechanics. Most notably their properties are not continuous but quantized. Quantization happens in Planck's scale, i.e. in very, very small bundles. Plancs constant h=6.62607015 Ã— 10<sup>-34</sup>,  describes the scale.    
Actually, it is that the quantization is distinquishable only in Planck's scale objects. For larger objects things get somehow averaged to follow the rules of classical Newtonian physics. We just don't quite understand it yet why this is as it is. Or maybe I just am not aware of it.

Photons, electrons, atoms and even molecules up to certain size are typical samples of quantum objects, per current understanding.  
Quantum object may have various measurable quantum properties like position, momentum, angular momentum, energy or spin. Like electron with it's spin, location and momentum among others.  
Normally only one property/state is dealt with in one test. It would get too complicated otherwise.   

Above objects and measurables are actually ones we have so far mostly been dealing with. Those that we have somewhat been able make out. I can imagine there's lots of objects and properties to be discovered, we haven't just been able to comprehend those yet with our limited understanding.

It was mentioned above, that normally only one property is measured as otherwise things get complicated. One such complication is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: it is not possible to simultaneously measure accurately two or more associated properties. Like position and velocity. The more precisely other one is measured, the more blurry it gets with the other one.
