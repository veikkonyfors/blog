## Electromagnetic radiation

Third part of [electromagnetism](../../../2022/09/18/electromagnetism).

A stable electric charge creates a static electric field around it, as described in [electricity](../../../2022/09/19/electricity#electric-field). In practice, however, it is very seldom that charge is stable. Instead charges most always at least vibrate, unless they reach absolute zero temperature.  

Also, if charged object is moving in steady speed, it creates a [magnetic field](../../../2022/09/20/magnetism#electric-magnetism) around it.  

If the charge, however, is accelerating, it will emit photons, i.e. creates electromagnetic radiation.  
Electromagnetic radiation propagates as [electromagnetic waves](../../../2024/01/11/electromagnetic-wave) in space-time.
