## Electromagnetic radiation

Third part of [electromagnetism](../../../2022/09/18/electromagnetism).

A stable electric charge creates a static electric field around it, as described in [electricity](../../../2022/09/19/electricity#electric-field). In practice, however, it is very seldom that charge is stable. Instead charges most always at least vibrate, unless they reach absolute zero temperature.  

Also, if charged object is moving in steady speed, it creates a [magnetic field](../../../2022/09/20/magnetism#electric-magnetism) around it.  

If the charge, however, is accelerating, it will emit photons, i.e. creates electromagnetic radiation.  
Electromagnetic radiation propagates as [electromagnetic waves](../../../2024/01/11/electromagnetic-wave) in space-time.

Why is the charge accelerating then?  
Consider an electron on an atom's orbital. When it absorbs a photon, it will excite to a higher energy level. Meaning it changes it's location further away from nucleus. That necessarily involves acceleration of the electron in question. And another photon is then released in minuscule time => elctromagnetic radiation!  

But where did the absorbed photon then come from?

It all starts in [nuclear reactions]( "fusion and fission").  
Fusion reactions are taking place in stars all over our universe. Specifically in the [sun](../../../2022/01/31/tunneling), which matters the most to us on earth.  
Fission reactions take place in the stars towards the end of their life cycle, in supernova phase. When all initial material required in fusion (H, He, etc) have ran out, star enters supernova phase, in which also fission reactions are occurring.  
Here on earth, we cause fission reactions in our nuclear plants.

In these reactions gamma radiation, among other stuff, is released.  
Gamma radiation is form of electromagnetic radiation, i.e. photons. Gamma photons are the most energetic photons, having the shortest wavelength. These gamma photons then excite electrons on various types of atoms [on the way]( "even in the sun already, which contain minor amounts of other stuff than hydrogen and helium") (to earth ;). While these then relax, new photons are emitted with frequencies typical to the material in question. Including visible light.
