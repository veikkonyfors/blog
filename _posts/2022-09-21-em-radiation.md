## Electromagnetic radiation

Third part of [electromagnetism](../../../2022/09/18/electromagnetism).

A stable electric charge creates a static electric field around it, as described in [electricity](../../../2022/09/19/electricity#electric-field). In practice, however, it is very seldom that charge is stable. Instead charges most always at least vibrate, unless they reach absolute zero temperature.  

Also, if charged object is moving in steady speed, it creates a **magnetic field** around it.  
If you happen to have a magnetic field sensor, and charge passes by, you will meter the magnetic field.  A faint one first, growing until the charge is nearest to you and then fading away.  
Similarly,  if you with your sensor are moving steadily by a charge, you will meter a magnetic field.
However, if you and your magnetic field sensor are moving besides the charge with the same speed, you will not recognize magnetic field.  
It's all a question of reference frames.

If the charge, however, is accelerating it will emit photons, i.e. electromagnetic radiation is emitted.  

When another charge is brought nearby a steady charge, it will start to feel a force, characterized with [Coulomb's law](../../../2022/09/19/electricity#coulombslaw). And starts accelerating. The same happens for the originally steady charge, it starts to accelerate as well.  
Both of these charges then emit photons. Creating an [electromagnetic wave](../../../2024/01/11/electromagnetic-wave).
