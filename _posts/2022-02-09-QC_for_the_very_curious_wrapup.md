## Quantum Computing for the very curious wrapup

In this document I was originally to wrap up the Strangeworks’ paced repetition document named ’Quantum computing for the very curious’. Eventually ended up on wrapping up also information available in Qiskit’s and Azure’s documentation. Items incorporated are ones that I felt I was going to need as available supplementary material along the road. Exspecially on the first few hundred meters, where composing this document was a very good practical excersize to learn the stuff too. Kind of killing two birds with one stone.
Hopefully this document is helpfull fo other people as well. Third bird? :-)
