## Elementary particles

### Quark
An elementary subatomic particle carrying a fractional electric charge  
Building blocks of hadrons.  
Not yet directly observed.

#### Baryon
Composed of three quarks.  
Types: Matterparticle, Hadron.
Samples: Proton, neutron, lambda, sigma, xi.

#### Colour charge
A property of quarks and gluons.
Related to strong nuclear force, [QCD](#qcd "Quantum chromodynamics.").
Red, green or blue.  
Color quantum state is needed, as some hadrons, e.g. $\Delta^{++}$, consist of quarks with some incompatible quantum states otherwise.

#### Electron
Electric charge -$e$, spin +-$\frac{1}{2}$, mass $0.51 \frac{MeV}{c^2}$  

#### Electronvolt
Unit of energy required to have an electron moves through a voltage difference of 1V in an electric field. $1eV=1.602\cdot 10^{-19}J$

#### Hadron
Composed of quarks.

#### Proton
UUD baryon, +$e$, mass $1 \frac{GeV}{c^2}$ 

#### QCD
Quantumm chromodynamics, describes strong nuclear force.  
Red, green and blue colors add up to neutral.  
All quarks in the hadron need to have different color, resulting to a colorless hadron.  
E.g. a proton has UUD quarks, with each having a different color.  
Two of these quarks, at a time, continuously, interchange their colors by exchanging a gluon.  
Gluon becomes the force carrying particles between these quarks, mediating the strong nuclear force.
