# Electromagnetic Wave

By Googling one finds a lot of descriptions of electromagnetic wave being transversal sinusoidal orthogonal wave propagating through Universe's spacetime. All that information is essential in analysing behaviour and effects of these waves. And is enough if one wants just to calculate using [Maxwell's Equations](../../../2023/04/28/maxwell-equations) to produce real world applications.  
If one instead wants to comprehend what's underneath all that, that's not so clear at all.  
Here I try to dig into this from more philosophical perspective.

Shortly said, electromagnetic waves are disturbances in the electromagnetic field.  
Consists of two distinct fields, electric and magnetic, living in strict orthogonal synchronized co-operation with each other. For clarity, I will focus only on the electric field here, but things apply to magnetic one in concurrence.

What's the disturbance in the electric field then? How could that be depicted?  

Think of a large cube full of jelly kind of material. Each point in that cube can be tracked. Let this cube be our electric field.  
On the sideplanes of this cube one is able to vibrate any point along the plane to make it move ahead and back in one direction. Let this be our source for the EM radiation. Like vibrating electron on atom's shell or radio antenna or whatever.   
This makes adjacent points in sequence inside the cude to do same vibration in kind of hydraulic manner. Like as if a rope would wave through the cube. Speed being that of light. Wavelength depending on the pace of the vibration. Direction may be into any direction through the cube depending on the original vibration. Polarity remains the same throughout the propagation, or polarity would be rotational if originating vibration rotates.  
Think of this waving rope presenting the disturbance in the electric field.  

Now think of a case where we would vibrate the point at the sideplane only once. Only a single crest and through would travel through the rope. That's a single photon!

From here on, let's concentrate on the single photon case, traveling as a single through-crest pair in electric field.  
This single disturbance on the field describes the force a charge would experience had it been on the spot where the disturbance is passing.
