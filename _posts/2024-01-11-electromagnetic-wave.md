# Electromagnetic Wave

When an electric charge is moving, it makes the electric field fluctuate around it. An [electromagnetic wave](../../../2024/01/11/electromagnetic-wave) is created.  
Changing electric field then creates a changing magnetic field. One can demonstrate this by setting a compass next to an electric wire. Compass needle adjusts to magnetic field immediately when [electric current](../../../2022/09/19/electricity#electric-current) is turned on.  
It is also vice versa: changing magnetic field creates a changing electric field. This one can demonstrate by moving a magnet within a coil of electric wire. When tha magnet moves,magnetic field is changing and one can meter the electric flow in the coil.
