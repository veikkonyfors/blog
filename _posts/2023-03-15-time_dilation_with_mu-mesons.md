## Time Dilation with $$mu$$-mesons

Mu-mesons are born due to [cosmic rays]( "protons, atomic nuclei, electrons, positrons, gamma rays, neutrinos") bombing our atmosphere at approximately 15Km of height.

Speed of these mu mesons born depend on the energy of the cosmic ray involved, typically it will be very close to [speed of light]( "299,792,000 m/s" ).

A fraction of these mu-mesons head towards earth.

Half-life on $$mu$$-mesons is 2.2*10^-6 s. In that time muon with speed of 0.95c towards earth, will travel a distance of 0.95c
