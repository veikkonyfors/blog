## Time Dilation with $$\mu$$-mesons

In 1962 Frisch & Smith performed an experiment to demonstrate time dilation with muons (mu-mesons). Video is available in [YouTube](http://youtube.com/watch?v=tbsdrHlLfVQ).

In order to better understand what was going on, I summarize experiment with layman's understanding. 

In short they measure number of [muons]( "Mu-mesons are born due to cosmic rays bombing our atmosphere at approximately 15Km of height.
Speed of these born Mu-mesons depend on the energy of the cosmic ray involved, typically it will be pretty close to speed of light") 
decaying on top of a mountain at 2000m followed by the same measurement at sea level.  
Number of decaying muons at sea level should decrease in relation to muon's decay time, speed of muons and the distance traveled.

Half-life on $$\mu$$-mesons is 2.2*10^-6 s, which has been measured with laboratory experiments, e.g. with LHC. This is in muons own frame of reference.

Speed of muons analyzed is narrowed down to be 0.995c to 0.9954c by:  
- A pile of metal bricks above the measurement apparatus, which will stop all muons with speed less than 0.995c.  
The measurement device itself underneath is a device called scintillator. A cylinder filled with specific combound of plastic.  
This compound reacts to muon decays by generating a pulse of light (photon) which can the be detected.  
Compound is also so 'thick', that it slows down muons a lot more than air does. With height of 60 cm, all muons traveling slower than 0.9954c will stop in the cylinder and then decay. Muons with higher speed will most likely pass through device without decaying.

On top of the mountain they counted 568 decays in one hour.  
147 of those were ones, that took more than 6 microseconds to decay in scintillator. In 6 microseconds our muons would had traveled the 2000 meters from top of the mountain to sea-level in the air.  Expectation is, that when they repeat experiment at sea level, they should count about 147 decays there.

At sea level, they reduced the pile of iron a bit to compensate for the 2000m of air.

When they counted decays in one hour at sea level, they ended up at 412. Quite a bit more.

If we calculate how much time it would take muons, with 2.2*10^-6s half time, to drop down from 568 to 412, it would take 0.7 microseconds. Indicating that 0.7 microseconds had passed in the muon's frame of reference.

This matches perfectly with Lorenz factor.
