# About this blog 

This blog was originally aimed in aiding myself to get acquainted on quantum mechanics. Maintaining the blog was a part of studying the issue per [Feynman's method](https://todoist.com/inspiration/feynman-technique)  
Along the path, several other categories had to be taken under investigation as well.

Method itself is iterative. One starts describing the problem with initial understanding. More details will be added as digestion of the matter in hand gets deeper. One may be able deepen insight, document things in more simple way or there may even be **corrective modifications**.


### So Be Warned! Information in this blog is per my current, evolving understanding. Which may turn out to be misinformation later on.
