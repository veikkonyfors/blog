# Electromagnetism

## Fields created by a charge

Charged object creates an **electric field** around it, as described in [Electricity](../../../2022/09/19/electricity.html). If the object is motionless, that's it.  

If charged object is moving in steady speed, it creates also a **magnetic field** around it.  
If you happen to have a magnetic field sensor, and charge passes by, you will meter the magnetic field.  A faint one first, growing until the charge is nearest to you and then fading away.  
Similarly,  if you with your sensor are moving steadily by a charge, you will meter a magnetic field.
However, if you and your magnetic field sensor are moving besides the charge with the same speed, you will not recognize magnetic field.

It's all a question of reference frames.

Additionally, an accelerating charge will emit Electromagnetic radiation, i.e. photons. 

When another charge is brought nearby a steady charge, it will start to feel a force, characterized with Coulomb's law. And starts accelerating. The same happens for the originally steady charge, it starts to accelerate as well.  
Both of these charges then emit photons. Which in turn are force carriers for the electromagnetic force. See article [Subatomic particles](../../../2022/09/29/subatomic-particles.html).  
Which one was first, hen or egg? The force causing the acceleration or the photons caused by the accelerations.

## Magnetic flux

Unit is Tesla: $T=\frac{kg}{s^2\cdot A^1}$
