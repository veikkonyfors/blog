## Electromagnetism

In order to be able to proceed acquainting on quantum mechanics and general relativity, it became evident one needs to be somewhat familiar with electromagnetism. Actually quite a lot.  
That was my intuition from the beginning, but now it has turned out to be a necessity to carry on with. Thus, now familiarizing with electromagnetism as well.  

A stable [electric charge]( "electron, proton, ion, or any object with imbalance of protons and neutrons") creates a static electric field around it, as described [electricity](../../../2022/09/19/electricity#electric-field). In practice, however, it is very seldom that charge is stable. Instead charges most always at least vibrate, unless they reach absolute zero temperature.  

Also, if charged object is moving in steady speed, it creates a [magnetic field](../../../2022/09/20/magnetism#electric-magnetism) around it.  

If the charge, however, is accelerating, it will emit photons, i.e. creates [electromagnetic radiation](../../../2022/09/21/em-radiation).  
Electromagnetic radiation propagates as [electromagnetic waves](../../../2024/01/11/electromagnetic-wave) in space-time.
