## Electromagnetism

In order to be able to proceed acquainting on quantum mechanics and general relativity, it became evident one needs to be somewhat familiar with electromagnetism. Actually quite a lot.  
That was my intuition from the beginning, but now it has turned out to be a necessity to carry on with. Thus, now familiarizing with electromagnetism as well.  

Starting this journey with wrapping up some of the main points in electricity.  
Followed by a summary on magnetism.
Finalized with an outline of electromagnetic radiation.  

After those some more related details, such as Maxwell Equations.
