## Electromagnetism

In order to be able to proceed acquainting on quantum mechanics and general relativity, it became evident one needs to be somewhat familiar with electromagnetism. Actually quite a lot.  
That was my intuition from the beginning, but now it has turned out to be a necessity to carry on with. Thus, now familiarizing with electromagnetism as well.  

A stable [electric charge]( "electron, proton, ion, or any object with imbalance of protons and neutrons") creates a static electric field around it, as described [electricity](../../../2022/09/19/electricity#electric-field). Being stable here doesn't stand for stability associated with reference frames but instead it implies charge not being affected by any external forces or interacting with other objects. Like an electron staying on atom's orbit or a free electron not interacting with other particles. 

If charged object is moving in steady speed, it also creates a [magnetic field](../../../2022/09/20/magnetism#electric-magnetism) around it.  
E.g. when electrons are moving in a wire, observer standing next to the wire will be able to measure magnetic field caused by the electric current in the wire.  
Frame of reference is essential here, if the observer would be moving along the wire with the speed of electrons, no magnetic field would be observed due to electrons running in the wire.

And furthermore, if the charge is accelerating, it will emit photons, i.e. creates [electromagnetic radiation](../../../2022/09/21/em-radiation). As happens when atom's electron gets excited.

Electromagnetic radiation propagates as [electromagnetic waves](../../../2024/01/11/electromagnetic-wave) in space-time.

however, it is very seldom that charge is stable. Instead charges most always at least vibrate, unless they reach absolute zero temperature.
