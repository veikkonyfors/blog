# Advent of Code year 2020 with Android Studio and Kotlin

As described in article [Kotlin in Android, for a dummy](../../../2022/11/03/kotlin-in-android-for-a-dummy), I needed a rest from Quantum Mechanis, Relativity, Electromagnetism and all that. And started to get acquainted with Android development in Kotlin language. With [petrol](https://github.com/veikkonyfors/petrol "Petrol price tracking") application.  

However, after a while, I discovered [Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/), which I thought would make this exploring much more fun. 

*Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.*

Even if some Jupyter environment would had been most effective to solve the puzzles, I chose to use Android Studio with Kotlin instead, for all the puzzles. Just to get familiarized with Android and Kotlin. Albeit the puzzles have nothing to do with Android.

This years first puzzle opens 1st of December only. Thus I took year 2020 under work to leave a year's margin. Just in case I wouldn't run out of puzzles ;-).  
Please check how I have advanced at [https://github.com/veikkonyfors/AdventOfCode2020](https://github.com/veikkonyfors/AdventOfCode2020).
