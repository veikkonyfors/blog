# About Quantum mysteries 

In these articles I am trying to clarify mysteries of Quantum Mechanics, mainly to myself. On very high level to start with. Pointed out with pretty simple minded common sense terms.  

I will add more flesh on the bones as time permits and comprehension allows.  
Eventually, there will hopefully be information on even 'genetic' level in addition to bones and muscles ;-)  

At the same time, I am familiarizing myself with GitHub Blogs.  

I warmly welcome comments, advice, counsel and such from the audience. Both on mysteries themselves but also on making use of GitHub Blogs
