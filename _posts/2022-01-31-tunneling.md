## Tunneling
In tunneling phenomenon an elementary particle jumps over a barrier in an incomprehensible way, incomprehensible at least from classical mechanics' point of view.  

Tunneling is taking place e.g. in the Sun, making it possible for the Sun to produce all that energy by hydrogen->helium fusion. In this fusion, protons of two hydrogen atom's nuclei get very close to each other. But there still is the barrier of rebelling coulomb forces between the positive charges. This barrier is in some exceptional cases crossed over, as the wave function has a tiny probability of the proton existing on the other side of barrier. Once the barrier is crossed, a fusion of those two protons take place due to attracting strong nuclear force, and a Helium atom is born. A lot of energy as gamma rays is released together with some subatomic particles. Including photons.

In double slit experiment similar thing to tunneling seems to go on. Wave function for the photon allows part of photon's 'energy' go through one slit and the rest goes through the other. Building up the interference on the other side.

Doesn't sound so mysterious at all to me. I must have misunderstood the whole thing, Feynman might suggest. ;-)
