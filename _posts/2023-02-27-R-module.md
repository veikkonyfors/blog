# R Module

Have been wondering how the resources in res xml files get to be usable in kotlin code. Answer is R module.

R module gets generated by Android Studio (as well as other IDEs like Eclipse) whenever you change something in res folder or rebuild app for a reason or another otherwise.  
Essential information [to be referenced]( ../../../2023/02/27/referencing-resources.html) from Kotlin and Java apps is contained nowadays (Android Studio Chipmunk | 2021.2.1) in 

./app/build/intermediates/compile_and_runtime_not_namespaced_r_class_jar/debug/R.jar
./app/build/intermediates/runtime_symbol_list/debug/R.txt

In the old days there seem to have been an alternate approach with R.java generated and compiled instead. That must have been in namespace *android.R*, whereas current implementation has R in app's own namespace, like *fi.viware.remeter_tabbedactivity.R*.  
With *android.R* available in R.java, one had to import it to one's own app, whereas nowadays one **must not** *import android.R* any more. As you can see in [Problem with unresolved resource references]( ../../../2023/02/20/prb-res-ref-unresolved.html). Resource references are nowadays in app's own default namespace.
