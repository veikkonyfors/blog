# About Quantum mysteries 

In this blog I am trying to clarify mysteries of Quantum Mechanics, mainly to myself. On very high level to start with. Pointed out with pretty simple minded common sense terms.  

I will add more flesh on the bones as time permits and comprehension allows.  
Eventually, there will hopefully be information on even 'genetic' level in addition to bones and muscles ;-)  

At the same time, I am familiarizing myself with GitHub Blogs.  

I warmly welcome comments, advice, counsel and such from the audience. Both on mysteries themselves but also on making use of GitHub Blogs

## Superposition

## Entanglement

It's like a pair of gloves. You normally have them both, right and left.  
But you could send one for Liisa, say the left hand one, and the other for Pekka. Once Liisa receives her glove, she knows right away that Pekka is receiving the right hand one.  
No mystery in that.

The same can go on with particles, e.g. between electrons in Cooper pair.  
In Cooper pair two electrons get bound together in low temperature superconducting state. These bound electrons must have opposite spins. They can be separated by a device called SET - Single-electron transistor. Once these electrons are transferred apart from each other, in leads of the SET, the spins are remaining opposite to each other.  
No mystery in this either. It's only hard to keep track where ever entangled electrons lie with limited human perception.
Which makes the whole stuff hard to catch for us humans.

## Tunneling
In tunneling phenomenon an elementary particle jumps over a barrier in an incomprehensible way, incomprehensible at least from classical mechanics' point of view.  

Tunneling is taking place e.g. in the Sun, making it possible for the Sun to produce all that energy by hydrogen->helium fusion. In this fusion, protons of two hydrogen atom's nuclei get very close to each other. But there still is the barrier of rebelling coulomb forces between the positive charges. This barrier is in some exceptional cases crossed over, as the wave function has a tiny probability of the proton existing on the other side of barrier. Once the barrier is crossed, a fusion of those two protons take place due to attracting strong nuclear force, and a Helium atom is born. A lot of energy as gamma rays is released together with some subatomic particles.

In double slit experiment similar thing to tunneling seems to go on. Wave function for the photon allows part of photon's 'energy' go through one slit and the rest goes through the other. Building up the interference on the other side.

Doesn't sound so mysterious at all to me. I must have misunderstood the whole thing, Feynman would say. ;-)
