## Magnetism

Second element in [electromagnetism](../../../2022/09/18/electromagnetism).

There's two types of magnetism, static and electric.

### Static Magnetism

Static magnetism is the kind of magnetism where e.g. two pieces of iron attract and/or repel each other if they are brought near enough to each other.  
Magnetic force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, thus if the distance is big, the force is not big enough to cause any motion. But even in this case magnetic items are adjusting to the magnetic field to reach the minimal energy level. This is what we see with compass needle.  

Static magnetism is given birth at particle level by electrons, accumulated from there first to atoms and eventually to compounds of atoms, like the horse shoe magnet and compass needle.

#### Electron level

Electrons have a property called [Magnetic Quantum Number (m_l)](../../../2023/10/12/what's-holding-things-solid.html#electron). This number is either positive, negative or zero, with the absolute value being that of Angular Momentum Quantum Number (l) minus 1.  
Being positive, makes the electron to be 'magnetized' to opposite direction of a negative one. Each individual electron will then adjust to magnetic field around by turning towards either north or south pole of the field, depending whether m_l is positive or negative.

### Atom level

Each orbital of an atom can hold maximum of two electrons. If there is two, electrons will cancel out each other's m_l. Thus, electrons on full lower level orbitals will not cause any magnetic influence.  
It's different with the highest partially filled orbital. Or orbitals, as energy wise it may be more beneficial to locate an electron not to the next free orbital but a higher orbital instead. Depends on case. For this reason an atom may end up having several electrons on outer orbitals with matching m_l.  
This is what may make an atom 'magnetic'. It will react to magnetic field around it depending whether accumulated m_l is positive or negative.  
Chemical elements with partially filled outer orbital are keen on having unpaired electrons ending up on more than one of it's outer shells, thus making the atom even more 'magnetic'.  
Iron, cobalt and nickel are good examples of such.

### Compund level

When forming a compound, atom can locate themselves magnetically oriented in the same direction or in opposite direction one by one. Depends on materials chemical properties which way it goes.  
Again, Fe, Co and  Ni are good examples of the first one. By doing so, the compound becomes even more magnetic.
