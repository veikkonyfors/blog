# About redshift

Have you ever pondered how do they deduce how far away some star or galaxy is located. They say it can be seen from redshift of the light from that source. For me that's a bit of mystery still. What's the redshift method based on, I wonder.

Basic assumption is that a star, galaxy or any cosmological object is spreading all frequencies of electromagnetic radiation in specific proportions. What those proprtions are, or how can we get to know them for a specific object, that's a bit of mystery for me.

But now, anyway, when the radiation is traveling towards us, the universe is spreading out at an accelerating speed at the same time. This makes the wave length appear longer to us when perceived. As like in Doppler effect, speed of radiation remains constant c, but as we travel further away from the source, peaks and troughs of radiation get further away. I.e. wave length increases, turning the radiation to shift a bit to the red side of the spektrum. Originally blue light turns towards green.  

If the universe would spread in a steady speed, the amount of red shift would always be the same. But now, when the speed is accelerating, the longer the radiation has been on the way, the more the wave length has increased.

Assuming the original spektrum to be of specific kind, analysing it with prism or gratings, we end up seeing a slightly different spektrum here. From that difference we can tell how long the radiation has been on it's way.
