## Double slit experiment

From 17th century onwards light was believed to be formed by particles as per Sir Isaac Newton's understanding.  
At the very beginning of 19th century, Thomas Young proved light must be of wave nature by his double slit experiment.   
Which ones is it in the end? See [Being a particle](https://veikkonyfors.github.io/blog/2022/03/15/being-a-particle.html) for that.  
Later on double slit experiment has been refined in various ways. E.g. it has been shown to work for electrons, atoms and even molecules of moderate sizes.

One of the landmarks was repeating the test with single photons, which advanced laser techniques made available in 1970's.  
If single photons were fired one at a time, but in sequence one after another, an interference pattern appears. A proof for being of wave nature.  As if consecutive photons were aware of each other and ending up interacting with each other.  
Nothing like that. Instead, the single photon is partly passing through both slits and interfering with itself. As the slits are close enough to have the particle's wavefunction cover both with some probability. See [Tunneling](https://veikkonyfors.github.io/blog/2022/01/31/tunneling.html) for more details.  
A single photon will only create one dot on the screen. At the spot where partial photons' combined (interfered) wavefunctions give the highest probability. For the next photon one dot is again created, but not necessarily at the same spot as the previous one. Probabilities may be different this time. So after some thousands of single photons have been fired, a nice interference pattern starts to be visible on the detecting screen.

But it gets even more amazing. When a detector is assembled on the slit(s) to find out through which slit the photon traveled, guess what, interference pattern vanished! I.e. observing the photon just prior or after the slit stripped of the interference phenomenon. This is referred to as the 'Measurement Problem'. Making an observation on a particle in superposition makes it to loose it's superposition and to adopt a classical state instead. This is also referred as collapse of the wavefunction.

How could this be explained? Why making an observation will destroy the interference? I will give it a try in [Measurement problem explained](https://veikkonyfors.github.io/blog/2022/03/21/measurement-problem-explained.html)
